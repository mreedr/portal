CSS Grid:
- when items aren't justified/have an explicit height/width they will expand to the size of their grid container
- place-items === justify-items + align-items

- implicent vs explicit: implicit is auto generated while explicit is genreated with given size (ex 130px)

- can only animate in firefox currently
